## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have installed:

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shriii19/pictune-frontend.git
cd pictune-frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure environment variables:

Create `.env.development` for local development:
```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

For production deployment, configure the environment variable in your hosting platform (Vercel, Netlify, etc.):
```env
VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.com
```

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (default Vite port).

## Building for Production

Create a production build:
```bash
npm run build
```

Preview the production build:
```bash
npm run preview
```

## Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Import your repository in Vercel
3. Configure the environment variable:
   - Add `VITE_API_URL` with your backend URL
4. Deploy!

The `vercel.json` file is already configured for optimal deployment.

### Other Platforms

The app can be deployed to any static hosting platform:
- Netlify
- GitHub Pages
- AWS S3 + CloudFront

Make sure to:
1. Set the build command to `npm run build`
